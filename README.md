# Product List: Initial Phase Project - Make it Real TOP Program v30

Our project was developed using React.js for the frontend, which included Sass for preprocessing CSS, and Express.js for the backend. Additionally, we used a mock-database property of Make it Real for storing the products in the project. The project was deployed using Vercel and Render.

## Characteristics of the project:
- Allows storing of products in a list.
- Allows the user to edit and delete a selected product.
- The stored information is public and can be visualized by anyone who enters the link.
- Uses React for the user interface.
- Uses Express for the backend API.
- Uses Sass for the styles.
- Is deployed in Vercel and Render.

## Start running üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to obtain a copy of the running project in your local machine, for the purpose of development and testing.

### Prerequisites üìã

The things you will need to install the software are a computer that isn't too old, a text editor to help you read all the code with pretty colors, and the will to deal with code written by a group of 3 people learning how to program!

### Installation üîß

1. Clone the repositories to your local machine: 
```
git clone git@github.com:JuanCamiloClement/proyecto-inicial-frontend.git
```

and

```
git clone git@github.com:JuanCamiloClement/proyecto-inicial-backend.git
```

2. Change directory to /proyecto-inicial-frontend:
```
cd proyecto-inicial-frontend
```

Also change to proyecto-inicial-backend in the second repository:
```
cd proyecto-inicial-backend
```

3. Install the frontend and backend dependencies:

Node.js
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm

```

Make it Real database:
```
npm install --save @makeitrealcamp/db-mock
```

Sass:
```
npm install sass
```

CORS:
```
npm install cors
```

4. Run the code!

Make sure to be in each repository:
```
cd proyecto-inicial-frontend
```
Once there, execute
```
npm run dev
```
For the backend, execute the same commands. Remember to keep both running!

5. Access the application from your browser
